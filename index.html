        Hello! My name is Parah Anderson. I am a student at the University of South Carolina studying Computer Information System with a minor in Business Information Management. Iâ€™m passionate
        about working with computers and photography. My goal is to graduate college to go straight into the masters program to get my MBA and receive certifications along the way. To achieve the goals would be to gain internships so I can get a feeling of where I would like to work and what type of environment I would be suitable in. Along with that would start studying for certain certifications that would help me along the way such as CISA, A+, CISSP, and more. The type of employee I would like to be is one that you can be reliable towards and that you can be trustworthy with when it comes to certain projects.
